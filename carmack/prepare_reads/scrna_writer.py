"""Writes one TGIDX=NONE read into the scRNA arm's three STARsolo-shaped output files.

A ``TGIDX=NONE`` read carries no target index, so nothing anchors an insert past a
homopolymer run: the read is scRNA cDNA rather than TGIDX-tagged genomic material. This
arm trims R1 down to that cDNA insert, passes R2 through untouched, and synthesizes a
third barcodes FASTQ carrying that read's barcode and UMI - the shape STARsolo expects
for its own barcode/UMI-plus-cDNA read pair. Deciding where that trim falls and
performing it happen in two different places: ``insert_cut`` is asked for the trim point
where the reads are dispatched, in parallel, and the cut it answers with travels beside
the read to this writer, which performs the slice on the single thread that owns these
three files.

The two halves of that synthesized record come from two different sources. Its sequence
is read out of the header annotation's own value tags and is never re-sliced out of the
raw read: barcode extraction already wrote the corrected whitelist entry into the same
annotation the position came from, the scTIP arm already emits exactly those corrected
values in its own header, and because this is a multiome experiment the two arms are
joined downstream by barcode - so a raw slice here would present one physical cell under
two different barcodes and split its data in half whenever a sequencing error had been
corrected. Its quality has no such source, because a header carries no quality
information, so it is sliced out of the read's own quality string at each component's
recorded start, for that component's own declared length, never out to the matched
span's end. Slicing by the declared length is what keeps the record at one fixed total
width even when a corrected indel left a recorded span a base narrower or wider than the
component really is. The rare cost, accepted deliberately rather than chased for more
precision, is that one quality position inside that fixed window can really belong to
the neighbouring component - the same approximation CellRanger's CB/CY tag convention
already makes.

The writer also describes the layout of the barcodes record it synthesizes, so a tool
reading that FASTQ can find the cell barcode and the UMI without knowing the chemistry.

        the UMI's position key and the anchor sitting on the UMI's 3' side are both
        resolved once at construction and are already cached here, and ``write_read``
        slices at exactly what this returns, so deriving the same coordinate a second
        time beside the caller could only ever be a chance for one read to be given two

        index's span rather than the UMI's -- and what takes the per-read anchor scan

        ``r2_name`` rather than reused from ``ann``, since validating that R1 and R2
        actually pair up is a later driver's job, not this method's.

        The barcodes record's sequence is taken from the annotation's value tags alone -
        the corrected whitelist barcodes barcode extraction already wrote there, joined
        in read-structure order by ``construct_full_barcode``, then the UMI's own tag
        value - and never re-sliced out of ``r1_seq``. The scTIP arm emits exactly those

        downstream by barcode, so re-deriving raw bases here would fragment one physical
        cell into two apparent cells whenever a sequencing error had been corrected. Its
        quality has to come from the read, because a header carries no quality
        information, and is taken from each component's recorded start for that
        component's own declared length rather than out to the matched span's end, which
        is what holds the record at one fixed total width across every read. The
        accepted limitation is that a corrected indel can leave one quality position in

        trust: a second check here would duplicate that guard and could disagree with
        the tallies kept beside it, leaving the stage counting one thing and writing
        another. The sequence and quality still arrive full and untrimmed for the same

        at each component's recorded start, in the original read's coordinates, which
