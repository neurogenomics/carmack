"""Per-read dispatch and the streaming driver for the prepare-reads stage.

For each UMI- and target-annotated R1 read, ``ReadPreparer.prepare_read`` decides which of
two arms the read belongs to and tallies the outcome into a shared ``PrepareCounts``
accumulator. A read carrying no real target index (no ``TGIDX`` tag, or one set to
``NO_TARGET``) is unmatched and travels on whole: its insert start is settled here, off the
UMI span, and rides along on the outcome for a later scRNA writer to slice at, because that
writer needs the untrimmed read to take its barcode quality windows in the read's original
coordinates. A read carrying a real target index is matched: its insert start comes from the
same chemistry-agnostic ``insert_start`` arithmetic, just anchored off ``TGIDX_POS`` instead
of ``UMI_POS``, and its scTIP header is rendered up front so a later writer needs nothing
but the outcome to write the read. Both arms therefore settle their trim point in the same
place, in a worker, rather than one of them settling it on the thread that writes.

``ReadPreparer.prepare_reads`` is the streaming driver: it opens the paired input FASTQs,
pools ``prepare_read`` across a dynamic number of gzip writers -- three fixed files for the
scRNA arm plus one (R1, R2) pair per whitelisted target bucket -- and dispatches each
outcome to whichever writer its arm owns. R2 is never handed to a worker process: nothing
`prepare_read` computes depends on it, so shipping it through the pool would only pay
pickling and IPC cost for bytes the parent process already holds unchanged. Instead it is
threaded around the pool through a sidecar deque, kept aligned with the matching R1 batch by
the strict submission-order guarantee ``map_batches_in_order`` gives: a batch's R2 half is
pushed onto the sidecar the instant its R1 half is handed to the driver, and popped back off
only once that same batch's result has been drained, so the two halves can never come back
out of step even though only one of them ever crosses into a worker.

        A chemistry with no target index support never even looks for a ``TGIDX`` tag,
        since ``self.tgidx_key`` is ``None`` for it. Otherwise a read with no ``TGIDX``
        tag, or one set to ``NO_TARGET``, is unmatched; any other value is matched, and
        its insert start is computed off the end of its ``TGIDX_POS`` span.

        Both arms settle an insert start here. The matched arm computes its own; the
        unmatched arm asks the ``ScrnaWriter`` this stage already holds, which has the
        UMI's position key and its right anchor cached from its own construction, rather
        than this class re-deriving the same chemistry facts into a second set of
        attributes that could drift from the writer's. The deliberate consequence, worth
        stating because it moves where a corrupt header is refused: an unmatched read
        carrying no ``UMI_POS`` tag is now refused here, in the worker, rather than one
        dispatch later on the writer thread. It is the same ``ValueError`` from the same
        guard, raised a step earlier, and it makes this arm symmetrical with the matched
        arm, which has always raised here for a missing ``TGIDX_POS``.

        Settling both cuts here is also what lets one guard decide, for both arms,
        whether the read has an insert at all: a cut that has reached the read's end
        leaves nothing to write, so the read is dispatched nowhere and counted as
        rejected instead. The order the tallies are taken in carries that: ``total`` is
        bumped first and unconditionally, and an arm's own counter only once that arm's
        guard has passed, so the three-term reconciliation holds after every single call
        rather than only once a run has finished. On the matched arm the guard sits
        immediately after the cut and before the scTIP header is rendered, since a read
        about to be dropped needs no header and rendering one is the most expensive
        thing this method does. What still runs ahead of that guard is the refusal of a
        corrupt header, which outranks the drop: a read whose tags could not have come
        from a correctly run chain is refused whether or not its insert was sequenced,
        rather than being counted as a rejection it only looks like.

        Args:
            name: The read's annotated header, without its leading ``@``.
            seq: The read's full sequence.
            qual: The read's full quality string.
            counts: Accumulator the outcome is tallied into, mutated in place so a run
                allocates no per-read outcome-tally object.

        Returns:
            The unmatched or matched outcome for this read, or ``None`` when the cut
            settled for it has reached the end of the read and there is no insert left
            to write. A dropped read reaches no arm at all, and its R2 mate and its
            synthesized barcodes record go down with it: the driver writes all three of
            an unmatched read's files from the one call this ``None`` skips, so the
            scRNA arm's three files stay positionally in register -- the property every
            downstream consumer of that triple reads them by.

        Raises:

        Every input read is written exactly once, to exactly one output arm -- the scRNA

        a matched one -- unless its computed insert start has reached the end of the read,
        in which case it is written nowhere at all and counted as ``insert_not_sequenced``
        instead. That is this stage's one filtering case, and it exists because such a
        read has nothing left past its cut: written out, it would be a zero-length record,
        syntactically valid enough to clear every framing and length check and so to
        desync the next reader that meets it rather than to be refused by it. Reads
        written plus reads dropped therefore still reconciles with reads read -- the
        three-term invariant :class:`PrepareStats` states and checks. The decision is
        taken in the worker, where the cut is computed and the tallies are kept, so one
        guard covers both arms instead of each arm answering it wherever its own writer
        happens to run.

        Report files are written once the run is over: the ``prepare_stats.txt`` report,
        a ``detected_targets.txt`` giving the read count of just the arms and buckets
        that actually received one, and one MultiQC file per payload, since MultiQC
        builds one section out of one custom-content file and discards whatever a stage
        nests inside it. The detected-targets file exists because the stats report tells
        a machine nothing it can act on directly and the output directory tells it
        nothing at all: every whitelisted target's bucket is opened below, so an absent
        target still leaves a valid, empty bucket behind for a consumer to trip over,
        and the counts are what that consumer sizes its fan-out from. A
        ``none.barcodes.json`` layout sidecar is always written too, so a consumer can
        locate the cell barcode and the UMI in the barcodes record without re-deriving
        the chemistry.

        The output side opens a dynamic number of gzip writers: three fixed files plus
        one (R1, R2) pair per entry in the chemistry's target index whitelist, all of
        them held open for the whole run through a single :class:`~contextlib.ExitStack`
        rather than a fixed `with` tuple, since the whitelist's size is not known until
        the chemistry is resolved. Every one of those writers is entered before the
        :class:`~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` that follows them, with no
        exception: a `ProcessPoolExecutor` forks its workers on the first batch it is
        handed, and a forked worker inherits the write end of every compressor's input
        pipe that was already open at that point. A gzip writer entered AFTER the
        executor would therefore never see its pipe closed by the workers that inherited
        it, and closing it from the parent alone waits forever for a pipe some other
        process still holds open. `ExitStack` unwinds in the reverse of entry order, so
        entering the executor last is what makes it the first thing torn down -- releasing
        every inherited pipe end before any writer is asked to finish -- on every exit
        path, including the exception path a mismatched R1/R2 pair takes partway through
        a run.

        R2 never crosses into a worker process: `prepare_read` computes everything a
        writer needs from R1 alone, so R2 is threaded around the pool instead, held in a
        sidecar deque that `r1_batches_with_r2_sidecar` keeps aligned with the R1 batches
        actually submitted. `map_batches_in_order` yields a batch's outcome only once it
        has drained that batch's result, in the order the batches were submitted, so the
        sidecar's next entry is always the R2 half belonging to the outcome just yielded.

        Args:
            output_dir: Directory the generated files are written into.

    """Lazily pair a thinned R1 read stream against the full R2 stream it was cut from.

    R1 reaches this point already thinned: barcode extraction writes out only the
    reads whose barcode matched, and UMI extraction then drops the reads missing
    their anchor or too short to carry the UMI slice. Neither stage reorders or
    duplicates a survivor, and nothing filters R2 at all, so R1's reads are always an
    order-preserving subsequence of R2's. Pairing by position would therefore fall
    out of step at the first read R1 lost. Each R1 read's partner is instead searched
    for by advancing R2 and discarding what it hands back until the ids agree, which
    that subsequence property is exactly what makes sound: every R1 read's partner
    lies somewhere ahead in R2, and every R2 read passed over on the way to it is one
    upstream filtering already discarded. R2 outliving R1 is how a healthy run ends,
    so the stream simply stops once R1 does.

    Laziness is an R1-side guarantee only, and unavoidably so. Nothing is ever pulled
    from R1 beyond the read currently being matched, so a caller that bounds its own
    consumption bounds how far into R1 the pairing runs. R2 can carry no such
    promise: skipping ahead cannot know a partner is absent until the stream ends, so
