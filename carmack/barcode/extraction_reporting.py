    """
    Choose which ranks to plot from a curve of ``n`` barcodes, spaced logarithmically.

    A rank curve is read on log axes, so the points that carry its shape have to be
    spaced logarithmically too. Thinning uniformly would spend almost the whole budget
    on the flat tail and leave the knee, the part anyone actually reads, drawn by a
    handful of points.

    The result holds at most ``max_points`` ranks rather than exactly that many. At the
    low end consecutive log steps are far less than one rank apart, so several of them
    round to the same integer rank and collapse into one. The budget is an upper bound,
    and the length must not be read back as a count of anything.

    Ranks 1 and ``n`` are seeded literally instead of being left to the loop's float
    arithmetic. They carry the two numbers a reader takes off this chart, the top
    barcode's depth and the number of barcodes observed, and ``round(exp(log(n)))``
    landing a rank either side of ``n`` would misreport the second of them silently.
    The interior is clamped into ``[2, n - 1]`` for the same reason: the bound then
    holds by construction rather than by trusting the exponential to stay inside it.

    A budget below two points cannot carry both endpoints at once, so there is no curve
    to draw and it raises. Truncating to a two-element list instead would quietly
    violate the very bound the argument was asking for.

    Args:
        n: Number of barcodes on the curve, which is also the largest rank available.
        max_points: Upper bound on how many ranks are returned. Must be at least 2
            whenever ``n`` exceeds it.

    Returns:
        Strictly ascending ranks starting at 1 and ending at ``n``, or an empty list

    """
    Build a MultiQC "linegraph" custom-content payload of the barcode rank curve.

    This is a module-level function rather than a method on ExtractionStats because the
    per-barcode counts it plots live on the accumulator and never reach the finalized
    stats object, which keeps only the top ten. Threading the whole counter through
    ``finalize()`` purely so this builder could sit beside its siblings would be the
    larger change, and would hang a per-barcode dict off a dataclass that exists to
    stay small.

    Three details of the payload are load-bearing against MultiQC's custom-content
    parser rather than matters of taste.

    ``data`` is a list of ``[x, y]`` pairs and not an ``{x: y}`` mapping. The
    custom-content linegraph path renders a mapping's keys as lexically sorted strings,
    which puts '10' between '1' and '2' -- ruinous for a curve running from rank 1 to
    rank one million. A list of pairs is a first-class input shape MultiQC builds the
    mapping from itself, and it keeps the ranks integers throughout.

    An empty counter returns ``None`` rather than a payload carrying an empty pair
    list. MultiQC indexes the first point unguarded, so an empty list raises IndexError
    and takes down the entire report, not merely this section. The writer's own
    emptiness check does not catch it either, because ``{prefix: []}`` is a dict
    holding an empty list and so is truthy. The suppression has to happen here.

    ``smooth_points`` is set explicitly and derived as ``max_points + 1``. MultiQC
    re-bins any series longer than that threshold onto uniform index spacing, which
    flattens exactly the log spacing this chart exists to produce, and setting
    ``smooth_points`` to null does not disable the re-binning. Deriving the threshold
    from the budget in force means a caller raising ``max_points`` cannot silently walk
    back into it.

    Args:
        prefix: Sample identifier used to key the payload's ``data`` section.
        barcode_counts: Read count per full barcode. Zero-count entries are barcodes
            the run never observed and are excluded from the curve.
        max_points: Upper bound on how many ranks the curve is plotted at.

    Returns:
        MultiQC custom-content payload nested under carmack's shared parent section,
        holding one log-spaced rank/depth pair per plotted point, or None if no barcode
        was observed at all.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If more barcodes were observed than ``max_points`` and ``max_points``
            is below 2, raised by the downsampler, which cannot keep both endpoints.
