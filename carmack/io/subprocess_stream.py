        Whether the child's exit status describes its own work rather than ours.

        A write child is always answerable for how it exited. A read child only becomes
        answerable once the stream has been read to EOF, because closing a read pipe early
        sends SIGPIPE to the child: that status reports on the reader that walked away and
        says nothing about the input. Reads abandoned part-way through are ordinary here -
        a caller takes the first read to validate its header and drops the iterator when
        validation fails - so without this gate every such path would fail spuriously and
        bury the real error underneath.

        Once EOF has been reached the status matters again, and not only for truncation: a
        member with a flipped bit decompresses to the full line count and the full byte
        count with different contents, and gzip reports that solely through its exit
        status.

        Returns:
            True when a non-zero exit status is worth reporting to the caller.

            the pipe, or None where the pipe closed cleanly.
