"""Position-based ("linear") deduplication of aligned, paired-end BAM reads.

For each cell (grouped by a configurable barcode tag), reads are grouped by
chromosome and strand-aware fragment position, and only the single
highest-scoring read pair per group is kept. This is an alternative to
UMI-based deduplication, for chemistries with no UMI to key on.

This module implements a two-pass design. Pass 1 finds, for every duplicate
group, the (QNAME, read group, cell) identity of the best-scoring pair. The ``+`` strand key
tracks the BAM's own coordinate sort order, so those duplicate groups are
always contiguous -- but the ``-`` strand key does not: two reverse-strand R1
reads with the same fragment end but different starts can land at different,
non-adjacent positions in a coordinate-sorted file. A duplicate group is
therefore not guaranteed to be contiguous, which rules out a
single-pass/windowed design and requires seeing the whole file before any
winner is final. Pass 2 reopens the BAM and writes out both mates of every
winning pair, unchanged, to a coordinate-sorted, indexed output BAM.

A fragment key always includes its chromosome, so a duplicate group never
spans two contigs. Pass 1 uses this to bound its own memory: it resolves
winners one reference contig at a time (using the BAM's index), discarding
each contig's duplicate-group accumulator before moving to the next, rather
than holding one accumulator sized to the whole genome. A final scan over the
reads with no coordinate at all (both mates unmapped) accounts for them in
the run's stats without ever contributing a winner. Complete primary-pair identity
validation uses bounded-memory temporary SQLite storage, separate from the per-contig
duplicate-group map and the final winning-template set.
