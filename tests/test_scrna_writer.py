"""Tests for ScrnaWriter, which writes one TGIDX=NONE read into the scRNA arm's three
STARsolo-shaped output files: a trimmed R1 insert, a passthrough R2, and a synthesized
barcodes FASTQ carrying that read's barcode and UMI.

The barcodes record's two halves come from two different sources, and most of this file
exists to hold that split in place. Its sequence is read out of the header annotation's
own value tags - the corrected whitelist barcodes barcode extraction already wrote
there, concatenated in read-structure order by ``chemistry.construct_full_barcode``,
followed by the UMI's own tag value - and is never re-sliced out of the raw read. The
scTIP arm already emits exactly those corrected values in its ``CB=``/``UR=`` header,
and the two arms of one multiome experiment are joined downstream by barcode, so an arm
that re-derived raw, error-containing bases here would split one physical cell into two
apparent cells. The record's quality has no such source - a header carries no quality -
so it is sliced out of the read's own quality string at each component's recorded
start, for that component's own declared length, never out to the matched span's end.
Slicing by declared length is what keeps the record at one fixed total width (38bp for
``carmack_custom_seq_1_0``) even when a corrected indel left a recorded span a base
narrower or wider than the component really is. The rare consequence, accepted
deliberately rather than chased for more precision, is that one quality position inside
that fixed window can really belong to the neighbouring component.

``TestScrnaWriterInit`` covers the attributes ``__init__`` resolves and caches once at
construction time rather than re-deriving on every read: the chemistry itself, which
``write_read`` needs a handle on to call ``construct_full_barcode``; the UMI component;
the annotation key its position is recorded under; its right anchor (the anchor
``insert_start`` walks past to find where the trimmed R1 insert begins); and the
ordered tuple of barcode components, which fixes both the order barcode segments are
concatenated in and the declared length each one's quality is sliced by. Getting any of
these wrong at construction time would silently corrupt every read the writer ever
processes, since none of them are re-checked per read.

The UMI-less-chemistry test exists because ``ScrnaWriter`` is documented to fail
clearly, rather than derive nonsense from a ``None`` component, when constructed
directly against a chemistry that cannot supply a UMI. Every read this class is ever
handed in production already passed through extract-umis, which transitively
guarantees a UMI component exists, but the class must not trust that transitively.

The rest of the file covers ``write_read``. ``TestScrnaWriterWriteRead`` takes a read
whose every component matched cleanly and covers the R1 trim, the R2 passthrough, the
bare-read-id output headers, and barcode+UMI concatenation order.
``TestScrnaWriterEmitsCorrectedFixedWidthRecords`` drives the two cases a clean read
cannot reach: a recorded span whose raw bases disagree with the corrected value written
beside them, and a recorded span whose width disagrees with the component's declared
length. ``TestScrnaWriterBarcodeOrderIsStructural`` guards concatenation order against
ever hardcoding BC3/BC2/BC1, using a fabricated chemistry double.
``TestScrnaWriterMissingPositionTag`` and ``TestScrnaWriterMissingValueTag`` cover the
two per-read guards, one over the position tags quality is sliced by and one over the
value tags sequence is built from. ``TestScrnaWriterGoldenGzipRoundTrip`` is the only
test here that writes through a real gzip subprocess rather than an ``io.BytesIO()``.

The last two classes cover the split between deciding where R1 is cut and performing
the cut, which fall in two different processes. ``TestScrnaWriterInsertCut`` covers
``insert_cut``, the arithmetic side: the UMI's recorded span end handed to
``insert_start`` along with the chemistry's UMI right anchor, returning exactly what
that call returns for the caller to decide on. ``TestScrnaWriterCutIsGivenNotRecomputed``
covers the writing side: ``write_read`` slices R1 at the cut it is handed rather than at
one it derives for itself, which is pinned by handing it a cut that deliberately
disagrees with the one it would have derived - an assertion no implementation that
recomputes internally can pass. Those same tests pin that the barcodes record does not
move with the cut at all, because its quality windows are sliced in the original,
untrimmed read's coordinates rather than the trimmed insert's.

``TestScrnaWriterLayout`` covers ``layout``, the description of the barcodes record that
downstream tools read the cell barcode and UMI offsets from.

    Every read in ``TestScrnaWriterWriteRead`` matched cleanly, so for those reads the

    declared width all coincide - which means those tests cannot tell the contract apart
    from re-slicing the read. Correction breaks that coincidence in two independent ways,
    and both are ordinary rather than exotic, so both are driven here directly.

    A substitution makes the bases disagree. Barcode extraction records the whitelist
    entry it resolved to in the component's own value tag, and the scTIP arm already
    emits that corrected value in its ``CB=`` header; because the two arms of one
    multiome experiment are joined downstream by barcode, an scRNA arm that re-derived
    the raw bases would present the same physical cell under two different barcodes and
    split its data in half.

    An indel makes the widths disagree. The matcher searches window lengths either side
    of the declared length and keeps the best-scoring one, so a corrected span can be a
    base narrower or wider than the component really is. Quality has no source but the
    read itself, so it must still be sliced out of ``r1_qual`` - but from the recorded
    start for the component's own declared length, never out to the matched end, or the
    emitted record's total width would drift read to read. The rare cost, accepted
    deliberately, is that one quality position in that fixed window can belong to the

    been dispatched. It is derived here, as a method of its own, so the dispatcher can

    dispatcher is what stops one read getting two answers: the UMI's position key and the
    chemistry's UMI right anchor are already resolved and cached here, once, at
    construction, and ``write_read`` slices at whatever this returns.

    What the method must return is exactly ``insert_start``'s answer for the UMI's own
    recorded span end, with nothing laid over it. That includes a run which consumes the
    rest of the read, reported as reaching the read end rather than clamped back inside

    Deciding where R1 is cut and performing the cut now happen in two different
    processes: the cut is computed while the read is being dispatched, in parallel, and
    arrives at this writer as a value. A writer that recomputed it would still produce
    the right output for every read whose recorded spans agree with the cut it was
    handed - which is every read in the rest of this file - so the only way to tell the
    two implementations apart is to hand over a cut that deliberately disagrees, and
    assert the output follows the argument. That is what these tests do, and it is why
    the cut they pass is one this writer would never have derived for the read.

    The other half is what must NOT follow the cut. ``r1_seq`` and ``r1_qual`` still
    arrive full and untrimmed, because the barcodes record's quality is sliced at each
    component's recorded start, in the original read's coordinates, and those
    coordinates only mean anything against the untrimmed string. So the same read written
    at two different cuts must produce two different R1 records and byte-identical
    barcodes records.
