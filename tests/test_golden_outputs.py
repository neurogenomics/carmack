"""
Golden output regression baseline for the barcode, UMI and target assignment pipelines.

Each test runs a real extraction over a committed FASTQ input and compares every generated
output file against a blessed copy under ``tests/data/golden/expected/``. The point is not
to assert that the outputs are biologically correct, but to make any change in them
visible: a matcher change that shifts a single corrected barcode fails these tests and has
to be explained or re-blessed deliberately.

Tiers
-----
Three always-run cases cover the small inputs (200 reads of ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0``, 50
reads of ``hydrop``, and those same 200 reads padded out to the
``carmack_custom_seq_1_0_primd`` layout) and cost roughly fifteen seconds in total. Two
full-scale cases cover the 2000-read inputs and carry the ``only_run_with_direct_target``
marker, so the repo-root conftest skips them unless ``-k`` selects them. The full-scale
HyDrop case alone takes about two minutes twenty and still dominates the suite, accounting
for some 85% of the full-scale tier: that library barely matches the HyDrop chemistry, so
nearly every read falls through all three matcher tiers.

Each case covers every stage its chemistry supports. The ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0`` cases --
and the primd case, which shares that chemistry's components beyond its leading PRIMER_D --
run barcode extraction, UMI extraction, target assignment and prepare-reads; the HyDrop
cases stop after barcode extraction, because that chemistry declares neither a UMI
component nor a target index.

No real R2 was ever collected alongside either committed ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0`` R1
input, so the ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0`` cases pair a synthesized R2 golden fixture (see
``tests/data_generators/golden.py`` for its provenance) with the target-annotated R1
target assignment produced, and hand both to ``ReadPreparer`` as they stand. The fixture
goes in whole: barcode and UMI extraction have already dropped reads from that R1, so the
R2 reads with no R1 half left are exactly what a real run carries, and pairing them is
``ReadPreparer``'s job rather than the harness's. HyDrop supports neither UMI extraction
nor target assignment, so it never reaches prepare-reads and has no R2 fixture at all.

Determinism
-----------
``BarcodeExtractor.extract_barcodes`` drains its bounded in-flight window in submission
order, so ``bc_all``, ``bc_valid`` and ``r1_annotated`` are written in input order and
``bc_counts.csv`` orders ties by a ``Counter`` populated in that same order. The outputs are
byte-stable at any worker count. Every fixture here runs at ``n_workers=4`` precisely so
that the goldens cover a multi-batch, multi-worker configuration rather than the degenerate
single-batch one a single worker would produce.

``TargetAssigner.assign_targets`` drains that same bounded in-flight window in submission
order, so ``r1_tgidx`` is written in input order too, and ``tgidx_stats.txt`` folds the
per-batch tallies in that order, which leaves the report unaffected by how the reads were
batched at all. It runs at the same ``n_workers=4``, but its batch size comes from the
fixture rather than from the stage default: at the default every golden input would fit in
one batch, and the in-order fold this baseline is meant to cover would never be reached.
``GOLDEN_ASSIGN_BATCH_SIZE`` is chosen to put each of them over several batches instead.

``ReadPreparer.prepare_reads`` drains its own bounded in-flight window in submission order
too, so the unmatched arm's three files and each matched bucket's R1/R2 are written in the
target-annotated R1's own order, and ``prepare_stats.txt`` folds per-batch tallies in that
same order. It runs at the same ``n_workers=4``, with its own batch size chosen the same
way ``GOLDEN_ASSIGN_BATCH_SIZE`` is: ``GOLDEN_PREPARE_BATCH_SIZE`` puts each fixture over
several batches instead of the stage default's single one.

``fast=True`` is deliberately not used: it drops the AlignmentMatcher, which is exactly the
tier this baseline exists to protect.

Comparison rules
----------------
Gzipped text outputs are compared decompressed, and their goldens are stored decompressed
too. Gzip bytes depend on the compressing tool's version and settings, so they are not a
stable contract; the text inside them is. Plain-text outputs are compared verbatim, except
the stats reports, which are normalised through ``strip_report_run_details`` to drop the
Carmack version line and the generation timestamp.

The barcode rank plot is checked only for being a non-empty PNG. Matplotlib's raster output
varies with library version, backend and available fonts, so byte-comparing it would fail
on an unrelated environment change rather than on a pipeline regression.

MultiQC payload contract
------------------------
Alongside the per-file comparisons, every run is held to a contract that applies to any
``*_mqc.json`` it emits, whatever stage wrote it. MultiQC reads a custom-content file's
*top-level* ``data`` and never walks nested payloads, so a file bundling several payloads
under keys of a stage's own choosing is discarded whole -- and discarded with a warning
rather than an error, which is how a run goes on looking entirely healthy while the report
it produced quietly loses most of what was measured. Asserting the handful of payloads we
happen to know about would close that handful; asserting the contract over every file a
real run emits closes the class, for the stages carmack has today and for the ones it
grows.

Only the top level of ``data`` is asserted non-empty, never the per-sample level. Target
assignment deliberately never suppresses its target distribution, so a run in which nothing
matched legitimately emits ``data`` of ``{prefix: {}}``: empty per sample, truthy at the
top, and rendered by MultiQC exactly as intended. Asserting per-sample non-emptiness would
fail that run, which is the one whose distribution a reader most needs to see.

The expected file set is asserted per chemistry as well, so a payload that silently stops
being written is caught alongside one that is written malformed.

carmack_custom_seq_1_0_primd
----------------------------
The contract covers all three registered chemistries, and the third has no golden input to
run over. ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0_primd`` is ``carmack_custom_seq_1_0`` with a leading
PRIMER_D, which shifts every component after it, so running it over the committed
custom_seq input as it stands matches nothing at all and suppresses the conditional
payloads the contract most needs to see. Its fixture therefore builds an input at run time
by padding that same committed R1 out to the primd layout, which gives a run of the same
strength as its custom_seq counterpart. The pad length is read off the two read structures
rather than restated from PRIMER_D's length, because read geometry in this repo comes from
the ``ReadStructure`` and never from a per-chemistry constant. The committed R2 is paired
in unmodified: R2 carries no barcode structure, so it has nothing to shift.

That run is not blessed against anything. ``TestPrimdGoldenOutputs`` inherits the payload
contract alone and deliberately none of the golden-comparison mix-ins, because its input is
derived at run time rather than committed and there is nothing a golden could meaningfully
be taken from.

Regeneration
------------
The default path asserts. To re-bless the goldens after an intended change::

    CARMACK_REGEN_GOLDEN=1 python -m pytest tests/test_golden_outputs.py -q -p no:sugar
    CARMACK_REGEN_GOLDEN=1 python -m pytest tests/test_golden_outputs.py -q -p no:sugar -k golden

The first command re-blesses the always-run tier only. The second adds ``-k`` so the
full-scale tier is selected as well, and takes about two and three quarter minutes for the
whole 81-test tier. Always run pytest from the repo root, or a stale non-editable
``carmack`` in site-packages shadows the repo source and silently produces different files.
Review the resulting diff before committing it.

Regeneration touches the golden comparisons alone. The payload contract checks are
assertions about a shape MultiQC requires rather than comparisons against a blessed copy,
so they have nothing to re-bless and go on asserting under that environment variable too. A
failing contract check during a regeneration run is a real defect, not a stale golden.

class MqcPayloadContractChecks:
    """
    Contract checks holding for every MultiQC payload file a run emits, whatever wrote it.

    MultiQC reads a custom-content file's top-level ``data`` and never walks nested
    payloads, so a file bundling several payloads under keys of a stage's own choosing is
    discarded whole -- and discarded with a warning rather than an error, which is how a run
    can look entirely healthy while the report it produced is missing most of what was
    measured. A handful of per-stage assertions would close the handful of instances we
    happen to know about; asserting this contract over every file a real run emits closes
    the class of defect, for the stages carmack has today and for the ones it grows.

    Only the top level of ``data`` is asserted non-empty, never the per-sample level. Target
    assignment deliberately never suppresses its target distribution, so a run in which
    nothing matched legitimately emits ``data`` of ``{prefix: {}}``: empty per sample,
    truthy at the top, and rendered by MultiQC exactly as intended. Asserting per-sample
    non-emptiness would fail that run, which is the one whose distribution a reader most
    needs to see.

    Parametrising over the emitted files is not possible here. Parametrisation is resolved
    at collection time, and these files exist only once the module-scoped run fixture has
    executed, so each check walks the glob inside its own body instead. ``load_mqc_payloads``
    asserts that glob non-empty, so none of these checks can pass by walking nothing.
