"""Tests for the prepare-reads read preparer.

`ReadPreparer` dispatches one UMI- and target-annotated R1 read at a time to
either the scRNA (unmatched) arm or a matched scTIP target bucket, tallying
the outcome into a `PrepareCounts` accumulator as it goes. The module under
test does not exist yet, so every test here is expected to fail at collection
or on its very first call -- that failure is the correct state for this
stage of the work.

This file covers construction: the chemistry-derived parameters the
constructor resolves and caches once, and the fail-fast checks that reject a
chemistry it could never dispatch reads for.

It also covers the per-read dispatch body itself -- the unmatched arm, all
three branches of the matched arm's trim-point arithmetic, and the counters
both arms bump -- and the invariant that holds across repeated calls into the
same accumulator.

Both arms work out their own insert cut here, in the worker. The matched arm
always did; the unmatched arm's is asked of the scRNA writer that this stage
already builds once at construction, and is carried out on the outcome, so the
trim point is decided in the pool while the single writer thread is left with
nothing to do but slice at it. `TestPrepareReadUnmatchedCut` covers that cut,
the full untrimmed read it travels beside, and the header guard that now fires
here rather than on the writer thread.

Both arms then put one guard over that cut, and it is the only case this stage
filters. A read whose insert start has reached the end of the read has nothing
left to write, so it is answered with no outcome at all, counted as
`insert_not_sequenced`, and written to neither arm -- taking its R2 mate and its
synthesized barcodes record with it, which is what keeps the scRNA arm's three
files positionally in register. `TestPrepareReadInsertNotSequenced` covers the
guard read by read, `TestPrepareReadBatchWithDrops` the `None` a dropped read
leaves in its batch's slot, and `TestReadPreparerDropsKeepTheArmsInRegister` a
whole run: the files, the reconciling stats, and the two run-level artefacts a
drop must and must not appear in.

Finally it covers the two streaming helpers a later driver runs `prepare_read`
inside: pairing an R1 stream thinned by upstream filtering against the full R2
stream it was cut down from, skipping the R2 reads that no longer have an R1
half and raising only for an R1 read the remainder of R2 never carries, and
lazily grouping that paired stream into batches.

    unmatched read, after dispatch was already over. It is worked out here

    construction rather than derived from a second copy of the same chemistry
    facts, which is what stops one read ever getting two answers, and the tests
    below assert exactly that identity against a separately constructed writer.

    Two consequences follow. The sequence and quality on the outcome stay full

    writer slices the barcodes record's quality at each component's recorded
    start, in the original read's coordinates, and those coordinates mean nothing

    matched arm, which has always raised here for a missing `TGIDX_POS`.

    On a 2-colour instrument the absence of signal is read as a base call rather
    than as nothing, so a cluster that dies just after the scaffold comes back
    with the whole remainder of R1 as a run of the anchor base. Every tag the
    upstream stages wrote is intact, so the read arrives here looking perfectly
    healthy, and the forward scan that settles where the insert begins walks that
    run to the last base of the read. Cutting there leaves an empty sequence, and
    an empty FASTQ record is syntactically valid -- its sequence and quality lines
    agree at length zero -- so it clears every framing and length check downstream
    before desyncing the next reader that meets it. The read is therefore written
    to no arm at all, and counted instead.

    Every case below asserts BOTH halves of that, and neither half stands alone: a
    read silently dropped and never counted breaks the reconciliation the whole
    report is built on, and a read counted but still written out is the defect
    itself. What is deliberately never asserted anywhere in this class is that the
    written insert equals `seq[cut:]` -- the empty string satisfies that form
    vacuously, and that is precisely how this defect survived a suite that already
    covered both arms' trim arithmetic read by read.

    The ordering inside `prepare_read` is what the counter assertions pin.
    `counts.total` is bumped first and for every read alike, whatever becomes of
    it; the arm counter is bumped only once the guard has passed. So
    `unmatched + sum(target_counts.values()) + insert_not_sequenced == total`
    holds after every single call rather than only once a run is over.
